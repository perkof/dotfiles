# Dot Files Repo

Forked from [Mathiasâ€™s dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and customised for my own personal setup.

Steps:

1. Run ./bootstrap.sh
2. Run ./brewfile.sh
3. Run ./setup-vim.sh
4. Install Oh-my-Zsh
5. Setup iTerm:
    - Install fonts in iterm2 directory
    - Setup iTerm appearance preferences
    - Create iTerm profiles for Base16 themes (remember to match iTerm theme to .vimrc theme to Base16 shell script that is sourced in .zshrc)
6. Put commands you do not wish to source control in .extra
