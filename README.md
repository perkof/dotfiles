# Dot Files Repo

Forked from [Mathias’s dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and customised for my own personal setup.

Steps:
1. Run ./bootstrap.sh
2. Run ./brewfile.sh
3. Run ./setup-vim.sh
4. Install Oh-my-Zsh
5. Setup iTerm:
    - Install fonts in iterm2 directory
    - Setup iTerm appearance preferences
    - Create iTerm profiles for Base16 themes (remember to match iTerm theme to .vimrc theme to Base16 shell script that is sourced in .zshrc)
